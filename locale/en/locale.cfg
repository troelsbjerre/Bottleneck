bottleneck-stoplight=Bottleneck signal light

[mod-setting-name]
bottleneck-signals-per-tick=Signals per tick:
bottleneck-show-running-as=Style for running:
bottleneck-show-stopped-as=Style for stopped:
bottleneck-show-full-as=Style for full:
bottleneck-update-every-x-ticks=Update every x ticks:

[mode-setting-description]
bottleneck-signals-per-tick=How many signals are processed per tick. The higher this number the bigger impact on performance.
bottleneck-show-running-as=How should machines running normally be lit.
bottleneck-show-stopped-as=How should stopped machines be lit. These are machines that have empty input trays.
bottleneck-show-full-as=How should full machines be lit. These are machines that have full output trays.
bottleneck-update-every-x-ticks=Limit the update rate to get better performance.

[controls]
bottleneck-hotkey=Toggle bottleneck lights
