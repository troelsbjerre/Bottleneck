---

- Custom events for hotkeys.. by Nexela (Nicholas Dunn)

---

## 0.5.0 (2016-12-17)

- Changed data structure from list to table, to allow for the following:
- Removed entities now have their associated lights disappear instantly, instead at next update.
- Mod now scales to larger factories, since removing elements (either from mining or destruction) is now expected constant time instead of linear in the number of lights.

---

## 0.4.5 (2016-12-04)

- Fixed unhelpful options menu text

---

## 0.4.4 (2016-12-04)

---

## 0.4.3 (2016-10-03)

### Bugfixes

- 0.4.0 introduced caching of whether a mining drill was depleted, which was mistakenly also set if the drill was out of power.

---

## 0.4.2 (2016-10-02)

### Bugfixes

- re-introduced minor version numbers on global data. The use of function pointers inside global cause the function to be saved as well. This needs to be updated when loading a newer version of the mod, which includes minor versions.

---

## 0.4.1 (2016-10-02)

### Optimizations

- Only checking for fluid output as a last resort (speeds update up quite a bit)
- Clean transition from 'removing lights a few at a time' to 'all lights are off, so no need to check'.

---

## 0.4.0 (2016-10-01)

### Bugfixes

- Assemblers with fluid output now handled more consistently with the rest.
- Depletion of mines fixed (now explicitly searching for ore patches, since old method sometimes failed)

### Other

- Toggling the indicators now requires admin privileges, and toggling lights will now happen at the same rate as updates, instead of all in one tick

---

### Bugfixes

- Compatibility issue with unDecorator resolved

---

## 0.3.2 (2016-08-30)

## 0.3.1 (2016-08-30)

### Bugfixes

- New fantories would get a red light (but not update) if lights were turned off

---

## 0.3.0 (2016-08-29)

### Bugfixes

- Version number was not updated, which caused the position cache to not be filled, causing a crash

### Optimizations
